# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Establish baseline and analyze current project structure
  - Create git commit of current state as baseline
  - Scan and document all files in the project directory structure
  - Verify current Rust application builds and runs correctly
  - Test basic terminal functionality to establish working baseline
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Identify and classify legacy Python scripts
  - Analyze fix_terminal_ui.py, fix_ui_complete.py, fix_ui_rendering.py for current usage
  - Search Rust source code for any references to these Python scripts
  - Verify these scripts are not called by main.rs or any configuration files
  - Document the purpose and confirm they are safe to remove
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1_

- [x] 3. Remove legacy Python fix scripts
  - Delete fix_terminal_ui.py with git commit and descriptive message
  - Delete fix_ui_complete.py with git commit and descriptive message  
  - Delete fix_ui_rendering.py with git commit and descriptive message
  - Verify Rust application still builds and runs after each removal
  - Push each commit to GitHub for backup
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Clean up development mock files and test scripts
  - Remove dev-mocks directory (conflicts with no-mock-scripts requirement)
  - Remove test_wrapper.sh files from root and src-tauri directories
  - Commit each removal separately with descriptive messages
  - Verify application functionality remains intact after cleanup
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Remove system files and update .gitignore
  - Delete all .DS_Store files from project directories
  - Update .gitignore to prevent future .DS_Store commits
  - Commit the cleanup and .gitignore update
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 6. Analyze and verify Rust implementation completeness
  - Review main.rs to confirm it contains complete eframe/egui implementation
  - Verify all terminal functionality is implemented in Rust code
  - Confirm no dependencies on removed Python scripts or external components
  - Test multi-tab functionality and terminal interaction
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Validate and optimize configuration files
  - Analyze config.toml for valid paths and executable references
  - Test each configured tab to ensure executables launch correctly
  - Remove any legacy configuration entries from previous architecture
  - Commit any configuration optimizations
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 5.1_

- [x] 8. Analyze and clean up Cargo.toml dependencies
  - Review all dependencies in Cargo.toml for current usage
  - Search Rust source code to verify each dependency is actually used
  - Remove any unused dependencies from Tauri + React migration
  - Test build after dependency cleanup to ensure no breakage
  - Commit dependency cleanup with descriptive message
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 9. Evaluate Tauri infrastructure directories
  - Analyze capabilities/, gen/, and icons/ directories for current relevance
  - Determine if these directories are needed for current native Rust implementation
  - Remove unused Tauri-specific files if migration to native Rust is complete
  - Commit any removals with clear rationale in commit message
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3, 5.1_

- [ ] 10. Update and validate documentation
  - Review CHANGELOG.md, CONFIGURATION.md, TECHNICAL.md for accuracy
  - Update documentation to reflect current native Rust architecture
  - Remove outdated information about previous Tauri + React implementation
  - Ensure README.md accurately describes current functionality
  - Commit documentation updates
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 5.1, 5.3_

- [ ] 11. Final build and functionality verification
  - Perform complete cargo build --release from clean state
  - Test application launch and verify GUI displays correctly
  - Test each configured terminal tab launches and functions properly
  - Verify all TOML configuration entries work as expected
  - Document any issues found and resolution steps
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 4.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 12. Create change summary and provide rollback instructions
  - Generate comprehensive summary of all files removed and changes made
  - Document the impact of each change on application functionality
  - Provide clear rollback instructions for each major change
  - Create final commit with updated documentation
  - Push all changes to GitHub and verify remote repository is current
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
