# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the Audio Toolkit Shell project to identify and remove old implementations that are mixed with the current working implementation. The project appears to have evolved from a previous architecture and contains Python scripts (fix_terminal_ui.py, fix_ui_complete.py, fix_ui_rendering.py) that were used for fixing UI issues, which may no longer be needed. The goal is to clean up the codebase systematically, ensuring only the current working Rust/Tauri implementation remains while maintaining full functionality and improving maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Audio Toolkit Shell, I want to identify all old/unused implementations in the codebase, so that I can understand what needs to be cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify all Python scripts in the audio-toolkit-shell directory that appear to be temporary fixes
2. WHEN examining the main Rust implementation THEN the system SHALL verify that the current implementation is working correctly
3. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN the system SHALL ensure all referenced paths and executables are valid
4. IF old implementation files are found THEN the system SHALL document their purpose and current usage status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely remove old Python fix scripts that are no longer needed, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python fix scripts are identified THEN the system SHALL verify they are not currently being used by the main application
2. WHEN removing old scripts THEN the system SHALL ensure the main Rust application functionality remains intact
3. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL commit each removal separately for easy rollback if needed
4. IF any script is still needed THEN the system SHALL document why it should be retained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the current Rust implementation is the only active codebase, so that there's no confusion about which implementation is being used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project THEN the system SHALL confirm that main.rs contains the complete working implementation
2. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify all Cargo.toml dependencies are actually used
3. WHEN reviewing the build process THEN the system SHALL ensure only the Rust implementation is built and executed
4. IF multiple implementations exist THEN the system SHALL clearly identify which one is active

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up any unused dependencies or configuration files, so that the project has minimal overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Cargo.toml THEN the system SHALL identify any unused dependencies
2. WHEN checking configuration files THEN the system SHALL verify all settings are valid and used
3. WHEN examining file structure THEN the system SHALL identify any orphaned or temporary files
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL ensure the application still builds and runs correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all changes are properly version controlled, so that I can track the refactoring process and rollback if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any changes THEN the system SHALL commit each change separately with descriptive messages
2. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL push changes to GitHub after each commit
3. WHEN completing each task THEN the system SHALL show the user the specific changes made
4. IF any issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback instructions
