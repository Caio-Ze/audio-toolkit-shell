# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current main.rs file in the audio-toolkit-shell project has grown to over 3000 lines, making it difficult to maintain, test, and understand. This feature aims to refactor the monolithic main.rs file into 4-5 smaller, focused modules that maintain the same functionality while improving code organization, maintainability, and testability.

The refactoring will be done incrementally, starting with splitting into 2 files, testing, then continuing to split further until we have 4-5 well-organized modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main.rs file split into logical modules, so that the codebase is easier to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have 4-5 separate Rust files instead of one monolithic main.rs
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the total lines of code SHALL remain approximately the same across all files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to maintain identical functionality after refactoring, so that no existing features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the application SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN each incremental split is made THEN the application SHALL be tested to ensure it still works correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to follow Rust best practices, so that the code is idiomatic and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL have appropriate visibility modifiers (pub/private)
2. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL have proper documentation comments
3. WHEN modules are created THEN the module structure SHALL follow Rust naming conventions
4. WHEN modules are created THEN imports SHALL be organized and minimal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to be done incrementally, so that I can test and validate each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the first split is made THEN the system SHALL be divided into exactly 2 files (main.rs + 1 new module)
2. WHEN the first split is tested and validated THEN additional splits SHALL be made one at a time
3. WHEN each split is made THEN the developer SHALL test the application before proceeding
4. WHEN all splits are complete THEN the system SHALL have 4-5 total modules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear module boundaries based on functionality, so that related code is grouped together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN theme/color-related code SHALL be in a dedicated theme module
2. WHEN modules are created THEN terminal emulation logic SHALL be in a dedicated terminal module  
3. WHEN modules are created THEN ANSI sequence handling SHALL be logically grouped with terminal functionality
4. WHEN modules are created THEN the main.rs file SHALL only contain application entry point and high-level coordination
5. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL have minimal dependencies on other modules
