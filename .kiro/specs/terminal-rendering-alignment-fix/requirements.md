# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical rendering alignment issues in the Audio Toolkit Shell's terminal emulator. The current implementation incorrectly assumes all characters occupy a single column, causing layout misalignments when displaying wide characters (emojis, certain Unicode symbols, box-drawing characters). This results in cursor desynchronization and broken visual layouts that significantly impact the user experience. The solution involves implementing Unicode-width-aware character handling to ensure proper alignment and cursor positioning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Audio Toolkit Shell, I want all characters to display with correct alignment in the terminal, so that the interface appears professional and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal displays box-drawing characters THEN they SHALL align correctly with other text elements
2. WHEN the terminal displays emoji characters THEN they SHALL occupy the correct amount of space without causing misalignment
3. WHEN the terminal displays Unicode symbols THEN the cursor position SHALL remain synchronized with the visual layout
4. WHEN text wraps to a new line THEN the alignment SHALL be maintained across line boundaries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal emulator to handle character width correctly, so that wide characters don't break the layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wide character (width = 2) is written THEN the cursor SHALL advance by 2 positions
2. WHEN a normal character (width = 1) is written THEN the cursor SHALL advance by 1 position
3. WHEN a wide character would exceed the line boundary THEN it SHALL wrap to the next line
4. IF a wide character is placed THEN a placeholder SHALL be used for the second column position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the terminal rendering to skip placeholder characters during display, so that wide characters appear correctly without visual artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering terminal rows THEN placeholder characters ('\0') SHALL be skipped
2. WHEN displaying wide characters THEN only the actual character SHALL be rendered, not the placeholder
3. WHEN calculating text layout THEN placeholder positions SHALL not affect spacing
4. WHEN selecting text THEN placeholder characters SHALL not interfere with selection boundaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal to use the unicode-width crate for accurate character width detection, so that all Unicode characters are handled correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining character width THEN the system SHALL use the unicode-width crate
2. WHEN a character has undefined width THEN the system SHALL default to width 1
3. WHEN processing character input THEN width calculation SHALL be performed for each character
4. WHEN handling line wrapping THEN character width SHALL be considered in boundary calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the terminal cursor to remain properly positioned after displaying any type of character, so that subsequent text appears in the correct location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing any character THEN the cursor position SHALL be updated by the character's actual width
2. WHEN the cursor reaches the end of a line THEN it SHALL wrap to the beginning of the next line
3. WHEN a wide character causes line overflow THEN the character SHALL be placed on the next line
4. WHEN cursor positioning is updated THEN it SHALL remain within valid buffer boundaries
