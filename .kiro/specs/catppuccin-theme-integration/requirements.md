# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme into the Audio Toolkit Shell to provide a modern, cohesive visual interface. The current terminal application uses default egui colors which lack visual appeal and consistency. By implementing the Catppuccin Mocha theme, users will experience a professionally designed color palette that enhances readability and provides a pleasant development environment. The implementation will include theme constants, ANSI color mapping, and global UI theming to ensure consistency across all interface elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Audio Toolkit Shell, I want the application to use the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme, so that I have a visually appealing and modern interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use Catppuccin Mocha colors for all UI elements
2. WHEN displaying the terminal interface THEN background colors SHALL use the Catppuccin base color (#303446)
3. WHEN rendering text THEN the default text color SHALL use Catppuccin text color (#c6d0f5)
4. WHEN showing panels and windows THEN they SHALL use appropriate Catppuccin surface colors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ANSI color codes to map to semantically appropriate Catppuccin colors, so that terminal output maintains proper color semantics while using the theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing ANSI red color code (31) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin red (#e78284)
2. WHEN processing ANSI green color code (32) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin green (#a6d189)
3. WHEN processing ANSI blue color code (34) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin blue (#8caaee)
4. WHEN processing ANSI yellow color code (33) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin yellow (#e5c890)
5. WHEN processing ANSI magenta color code (35) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin mauve (#ca9ee6)
6. WHEN processing ANSI cyan color code (36) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin teal (#81c8be)
7. WHEN processing ANSI black color code (30) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin surface1 (#51576d)
8. WHEN processing ANSI white color code (37) THEN it SHALL display using Catppuccin text (#c6d0f5)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the terminal focus indicators to use theme-appropriate colors, so that I can easily identify which terminal is active while maintaining visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a terminal panel is focused THEN the title SHALL display in Catppuccin blue (#8caaee)
2. WHEN a terminal panel is not focused THEN the title SHALL display in Catppuccin subtext0 (#a5adce)
3. WHEN hovering over UI elements THEN they SHALL use appropriate Catppuccin accent colors
4. WHEN selecting text THEN the selection SHALL use Catppuccin surface colors for highlighting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme implementation to use compile-time constants, so that the application has optimal performance and consistent color values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining theme colors THEN they SHALL be implemented as compile-time constants
2. WHEN accessing theme colors THEN there SHALL be no runtime initialization overhead
3. WHEN building the application THEN all color values SHALL be validated at compile time
4. WHEN using theme colors THEN they SHALL be accessed through a structured theme interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want bright ANSI colors to maintain consistency with normal colors, so that the interface doesn't have jarring color variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing bright ANSI colors (90-97) THEN they SHALL map to the same Catppuccin colors as normal ANSI colors
2. WHEN displaying bright black (90) THEN it SHALL use Catppuccin surface2 (#626880) for subtle differentiation
3. WHEN processing any bright color code THEN it SHALL maintain semantic meaning while using theme colors
4. WHEN mixing normal and bright colors THEN the overall appearance SHALL remain harmonious

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the global egui style to be themed consistently, so that all UI elements follow the Catppuccin design language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting the global style THEN window fill SHALL use Catppuccin base color
2. WHEN setting the global style THEN panel fill SHALL use Catppuccin base color  
3. WHEN setting the global style THEN text color override SHALL use Catppuccin text color
4. WHEN applying the style THEN it SHALL affect all egui UI elements consistently
